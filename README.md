# Get Jazzy AJAX Get

## Base

- Move arrays into a `modules` folder
- Look at the pattern for the working `/artist` AJAX request. The client side is all set up for `/song`, but the server side code isn't there. Add the server side code.

## Stretch

The `/artist` and `/song` requests are working! Can you add a third table for albums that has `title` and `year` for the release date?
